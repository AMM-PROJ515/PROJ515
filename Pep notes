System overview

Sub systems
	Mobile autonomous platform
		In order to get to a position to pick up an object a platform that can autonomously navigate and localise in an area is required. This platform will need to know its current location, save its location with a tag and take commands to navigate to a desired tag. This system will comprise of a wheeled base to enable movement, a sensor(s) to enable the ability to localise and navigate, a computer to process data from the sensor(s) and a microcontroller to interface between the mobile platform and the computer

	Gripper
		To pick up objects we will need an end effector/grasping mechanism for the robot arm. This system will comprise of a mechanical grasping mechanism, a microcontroller to command the mechanism to open/close and lighting to improve object recognition from vision system

	Arm
		In order to manuvere the gripper to an object we will need a articuated robot arm. This system will comprise of a mechanical arm and a kinematic controller on a pc.


	Vision
		A vision system will be used to recognise and locate objects, that initially enables the mobile platform to find object and navigate to them, the vision system will also be used to command the arm to move the end effector to a coordinate and to know when to command the gripper to close. The vision system will comprise of two cameras, a 'head' camera positioned above the arm to reconise and locate objects from a distance, and a in hand camera to allow the gripper to home in on an object.
